# Rust Smart Contracts

This directory is an Anchor workspace generated with `anchor init blog`, mirroring the Solidity layout by keeping `Anchor.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `programs/`, and `tests/` at the root.

Add new Solana programs by running `anchor new <program-name>` here, or scaffold another workspace in a sibling folder if you truly need a separate setup.
